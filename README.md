# Sales-Dashboard-using-Excel
A sales dashboard using Excel that provides a visual representation of sales data, allowing managers to make informed decisions and monitor performance.
To create this dashboard,I have used a variety of functions in Excel, including Power Query, Power Pivot, and other built-in Excel functions. 
Power Query is a powerful data acquisition tool that allows you to connect to various data sources, including databases and spreadsheets, and extract the relevant data for your dashboard. 
You can also use Power Query to clean and transform the data, removing any irrelevant or duplicate information.
Power Pivot, on the other hand, is an Excel add-in that provides advanced data analysis capabilities, including the ability to create relationships between data sources, and build pivot tables and pivot charts. 
In this sales dashboard, i have used Power Pivot to create pivot tables that summarize the data and pivot charts that visualize the data in different ways, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
In addition to these tools, I have used other Excel functions to manipulate the data and create calculated fields. For example, you can use the SUM function to calculate the total sales, the AVERAGE function to calculate the average sales per period, and the IF function to create conditional statements that help you analyze the data.
Finally, by using Excel's formatting and layout tools to make the dashboard look professional and easy to read. For example, you can use color scales, conditional formatting, and data labels to highlight important information and make the data easier to understand.

By using these tools and functions in Excel, created a comprehensive and interactive sales dashboard that provides a clear and concise picture of your sales data and helps you make informed decisions.
